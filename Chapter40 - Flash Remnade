*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Having fallen victim to Roy Alphard of Gluttony, Otto Suwen was forcefully removed from the battlefield.

As one blessed with the Divine Protection of the Soul of Language, the man who had accumulated its highest level of mastery in history had done exactly as he had proclaimed; humiliating Aldebaran’s group, the enemies of the world, and inflicting great suffering upon them.

That was why the conclusion of his lonesome battle was brought about by a ruthless imprisonment that left no opening for counterattacks, leaving him completely helpless.

His words were sealed, his actions were sealed, his tricks were sealed, his wits were sealed; every weapon in his arsenal was sealed away, and finally, even the memories that defined who he was were stolen away, thus was how Otto Suwen was utterly defeated.

When Aldebaran’s group resolved to seal him away with such overwhelming force that gave no time to plan a countermeasure, even Otto found himself powerless, unable to resist.

Because it was impossible to predict exactly when and where his opponents would launch a counterattack, he was unable to construct a trap zone using his signature Divine Protection.

And so, there was absolutely nothing Otto Suwen could have done upon being attacked―― his last resort merely being a “desperate struggle” in the event of an assault.

――He had simply left instructions for the Zodda bugs to fly off en masse so that his location would have been revealed in the event he was defeated.

???: [Al knew Rem before they had met in the Empire… even before Gluttony ate her memories. There's no doubt about it.]

That was when the Imaginary Subaru voiced his opinion, while they were in the midst of planning a surprise attack.

With his arms and legs crossed as he sat midair, Subaru's stern face caused Petra to recall the events in the Royal Capital where Al and Rem had crossed paths through Subaru's memories.

That was when Subaru made a major blunder at the castle and was desperately trying to make up for it.

Although Petra did feel that Subaru's reckless behavior was quite bad, she did not feel completely disillusioned. However, Subaru himself remembered it as an utterly humiliating experience that made him squirm just thinking about it. In fact, everyone who was there must have looked down on Subaru's reckless behavior, so the only person who would not feel disillusioned by his actions, if we excluded Petra, would be Rem, who had been blindly devoted to him as far back as then.

Be that as it may, Subaru, unable to escape the cycle of negative emotions, visited Priscilla's mansion in search of a way to save Emilia, who was being attacked by the Witch Cult.

There, Subaru received an incredibly harsh and cold response from Priscilla, but the crucial connection between Al and Rem was revealed right there as he was being expelled from the mansion.

He did not know the specific reason, however――,

"Subaru": [Al mistakenly called Rem by Ram’s name and was extremely shocked by that fact. When I asked Rem about it, she said she had never met him before.]

Petra: [So Al-san knew about the two of them beforehand? Perhaps he researched the rival camps for the Royal Selection… or something like that?]

"Subaru": [So you are saying Al could have been in charge of the Priscilla camp's countermeasure against the other Royal Selection? I don't think that's impossible, but it doesn't really matter. The important thing is that Al knew Rem. In other words――]

Petra: [Just like with all of us, when Al-san sees Rem-neesma, his memories should get all mixed up.]

"Subaru": “That. ――I would call a Flash Remnade.”

With a silent snap of his fingers, Subaru winked, and Petra gave him a thumbs-up.

To be honest, Petra was reluctant to treat Rem like a flash grenade, but she and the others had already confirmed that there was no way to counteract the effects of memories returning.

Just like with Subaru in Petra or Ram, the deeper the relationship and attachment, the greater the impact, but even the slightest opening is an opening.

All that’s left is to take advantage of that opening――,

Petra: [Let's show Al-san ――just how angry we are.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――Here, a defense was offered for Roy Alphard, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony.

With his nature as a "gourmand" and having wielded the Authority of Gluttony, which had caused countless tragedies, Roy had completely incapacitated Otto Suwen, who had tormented the Aldebaran group. His "Eclipse" had not only rendered Otto powerless but had also devoured the entirety of his twenty-two years of life, having chewed through his joys, angers, sorrows ――everything swallowing it all in one gulp from the plate.

Having savored with a guttural sound, Roy had finished his intangible meal. With a precision and freshness surpassing the reading of the "Book of the Dead," he had tasted Otto Suwen’s life. He had deemed it a life that had overcome moderate hardships, had experienced a fair share of joys and sorrows, and had given it a slightly rich-flavored, two-star rating.

At the moment he had evaluated what he had consumed, there had already been a sense that he had inherited the "gourmet" spirit of his deceased brother, Lye Batenkaitos. But setting that aside, to have "devoured memories" meant to have known the way a person thought, their philosophy, and even, in the midst of battle, what they might have been scheming or planning.

Thus, under normal circumstances, even if Roy had defeated Otto and had been basking in the afterglow of victory or a sense of accomplishment, it should have been natural and easy for him to have detected a planned ambush immediately afterward.

However, that hadn’t happened. Why? Because Otto hadn’t shared the specifics of what his comrades would do after he had been taken down.

Otto Suwen had simply believed.

He had believed that if he could have just given a signal the moment he was defeated, his comrades would not have let it go to waste.

And so, because it had all been staked on that bond—neither a strategy nor a plan, but pure, unwavering trust――,

???: [――It is a pleasure to meet you, Aldebaran-sama.]

Unmistakably, it had happened in the blink of an eye.

A closing, and opening of the eyes. At the presence of the blue-haired girl who had interloped in that instant, while a matter of course for Aldebaran, neither Yae, nor Roy, nor even “Aldebaran” could react.

An outsider who was not supposed to be there, had suddenly appeared without warning.

That alone was enough to steal an instant from veteran soldiers, but in the place, the one onto which that had been most lethal, was Aldebaran, for whom it did not end with a mere instant.

Aldebaran: [――――]

Yae naturally had no acquaintance with her, Roy was exempt due to it being his own Authority, and “Aldebaran”, while sharing in his Memories, possessed a fundamentally different soul; thus it was a phenomenon that did not occur for any of them.

Stimulating the black-stained Memories etched into his soul, alongside the sensation of something that had been removed being forced back into his brain, Aldebaran’s consciousness went white.

Whoever said it, it was a flash grenade of Memories.

???: [――Al-sama!]

A shrill, frantic voice called to him, the hands that reached out from beyond his white stained vision grabbed hold of him. However, that did not save Aldebaran from his predicament.

Aldebaran: [――――]

The legs that were supposed to have been firmly planted on the ground hurtled through the air, and as Aldebaran basked in a ferocious wind, he lost his sense of up, down, left, and right, and realized his body had begun revolving.

Unable to control his body, still lording overhead was the blue sky in which shone the glaring sun―― as that radiance scorched his black eyes, Aldebaran realized something.

――Through some means, he had been teleported to the sky, thrown outside of his Territory.

Aldebaran: [――Hk! Expand Territory, <u>Matrix</u> Redefinition.]

Reestablishing the Territory that had been forcibly severed, Aldebaran grit his teeth.

Forced to go along with the opponent’s plans, he had been made to update his Matrix. ――No longer could he return to before the surprise attack a moment prior.

But, if he lagged behind in his decision to update, Aldebaran would have been defeated with nothing he could do about it.

Aldebaran’s Authority was invincible, but that was entirely within the bounds of the established Territory. Were he to perish outside of those bounds, he would be the same as the many lives who were not given any second chances.

Aldebaran: [――――]

Digesting the circumstances he had been placed in, Aldebaran’s consciousness concentrated on reality.

Given that he had been forced to update his Matrix, to Aldebaran, everything from here on out would be both a treasure and a calamity, a tailwind and a headwind, a virtue and an evil.

Aldebaran: [Sky…!!]

The roaring hum of the wind, the violent sense of suspension that seemed to strike his body; the fact that he was falling from a high altitude despite having no memory of being sent up, meant that the due procedures had been omitted.

For a moment, what came to Aldebaran’s mind was the Authority of the strongest Witch, but that could not be it. ――If the opponent had truly been that Witch, the phenomenon that occurred would have differed. He would not have been thrown out into the open air like this, and above all, Aldebaran would have been killed a hundred times over before he could even blink.

Hence, he could eliminate that possibility from the multitude of worst-case scenarios.

As he narrowed down the possibilities, he gathered his surrounding situation in parallel. At present, if there were any irregularities nearby Aldebaran as he was being jostled by the wind, that would be――,

???: [――Al-sama.]

Tightly grabbing onto Aldebaran’s single arm and clinging on, was Yae.

Just before he was thrown out into the sky, she had pounced on Aldebaran just as he had frozen up from eating the flash grenade of Memories, and thus had been sent up from the forest to the sky along with him.

Whether he ought to take that as a blessing or a curse, Aldebaran mentally separated the things he could and could not do now that Yae was here, and decided on the first thing he should do.

That was――,

Yae: [I’ll steady our posture! Al-sama, don’t part from me――]

Aldebaran: [Obugh.]

Simultaneous to Yae embracing him and attempting to form some sort of countermeasure against falling, Aldebaran unwrapped the drug package within his mouth, and gulped down the poison.

He could tell that Yae had widened her crimson eyes, and was looking at him with an expression of surprise. But, given that he had already ended up taking a lethal dose, there was no helping it.

Yae: [I’ll ask later.]

Blood frothed at the corners of his mouth, and tasting rusted iron as that mercilessly defiled the inside of his helmet, Aldebaran’s consciousness was crushed by the wind――,

×　　×　　×

Aldebaran: [――Hk.]

It was something he had known would happen, but reality seemed to follow up by greeting him with the howling wind.

When he opened his shut eyelids, ever present there was the odious radiance of the sun―― as it glared at him intently, Aldebaran grasped that he was surrounded by several hundreds of meters of sky.

Aldebaran: [You’ve gotta be kidding me.]

Teleport, instantaneous travel, <u>teleport</u>. ――No matter how one chose to express it, the result was the same; in the sense of manipulating physical space, that which fell under the sphere of Yin Magic was a hyper spell that necessitated all sorts of conditions be met.

If one carefully constructed the spell and constructed a field with that etched into it, it would be possible to create a limited warp connected by two doors through that field. Or probably even without advanced preparations, if a caster could visualize the coordinates of the destination, and constructed a spell to send their target there with the preparedness to fully expend their own gate, they might have been able to issue just a one-way ticket.

×　　×　　×

Ultimately, the phenomenon that had sent Aldebaran and Yae to the sky was at an impossible level of difficulty even if technically possible through magic, which meant that some other form of foul play was involved.

Not once had he heard of a Divine Protection that could physically interfere with others to this extent.

Of course, like in the case of Reinhard, Divine Protections thought to be trivial could be implemented in an unusual way, and there were also those who would end up tailoring them into dreadful weapons of war, but――,

Aldebaran: [――This ain’t it. But, if it was an Authority…]

As far as Aldebaran knew, the existing Authorities of Wrath, Gluttony, and Lust belonged to the Sin Archbishops, while Sloth and Greed were both in the possession of Natsuki Subaru.

Excluding Aldebaran’s Authority, which ought to be classified as all manners of unenumerated・ supernumerary・appropriated, the remaining possibilities were Pride, as well as Vanagloria and Tristitia. ――The last two were supposed to be unusable by anyone, so the only possibility remaining was Pride.

×　　×　　×

Aldebaran: [So Pride has come? Sprung up? Gotten involved? ――Nah, that’s not what matters.]

Be it someone Aldebaran knew who had been chosen as Pride, or be it someone he did not know who had gotten involved as Pride, that which he ought to focus on was the possibility that he had become the enemy of an Authority holder.

Save for Natsuki Subaru and Reinhard, the only variables that could pose a threat to Aldebaran were unmistakably those who held Authorities―― none other than those permitted to bend the rules of the world, trampling upon them as they pleased, the destroyers of concepts.

×　　×　　×

Aldebaran: [――<u>Alright</u>, settled down.]

Are you finally done panicking after being forced along to your enemy’s plans? Feeling as if he heard those words in the howling, Aldebaran gave his reply.

In order to be able to do so, Aldebaran had sorted out the situation in his head.

Of course, the actual circumstances of being thrown out into the sky, the regret he had about Yae having come along with him, and the sensation of his consciousness being whited-out by the resurgence of Memories, in reality none of that had changed.

But, that was a cheap price to pay if he did not die for real. Such was Aldebaran’s life.

In exchange for that dirt-cheap price, he could easily afford to let his head, body, and mind take a breather.

???: [――Al-sama.]

Yae grabbed onto Aldebaran’s single arm, and seeing as her tied up hair violently fluttered like a dog’s tail in good spirits, Aldebaran advanced his thoughts onto the next phase.

With both himself and Yae alive, they would need to land on the ground.

For that purpose――,

Yae: [I’ll steady our posture! Al-sama, don’t part from me――]

Aldebaran: [Nah, that’s my line.]

As Yae enthusiastically tried to act on her own decision after being thrown out into the sky, Aldebaran hindered her by forcibly pulling her into his own chest. Because he had used his right arm to do so, he rapidly forged the usual stone prosthetic arm, and rose it aloft―― that instant, a vehement impact struck the prosthetic arm from above, adding speed to their free fall.

Heavily reverberating across the artificial arm, was a blow from a dreadful and fiendish lump of iron. Mixing in with the tremendous voice of the wind, it was a threat present at the end of the clangoring chains, dancing like a writhing snake.

Contrary to its name, it was a spiked iron ball with a form designed to put people into an eternal sleep――,

???: [――Prepare yourselves!]

On the other side of the iron ball that had smashed into him, descending was a blue-haired girl who appeared to carry the sun on her back. Having greatly diminished Aldebaran’s advantage, the opponent who had shot up the signal for the commencement of the battle―― Rem bellowed.

Slowly protruding from her forehead was a single horn. It was a sign that she was of the Oni clan, proof that she was a member of the race created to decisively purge this world of all traces of the Witch(es).

But even more than that, it held a different meaning to Aldebaran, now that he had remembered her.

That was――,

Aldebaran: [To begin with, you’re not even supposed to be alive, lil’ miss Rem!!]

△▼△▼△▼△

Rem leapt into the air with resolve, the hem of her maid uniform fluttering behind her, and gripped the handle of the Morning Star tightly in her hand as she glared down at Al and the others below.

――Up to this point, the surprise attack had gone perfectly according to plan.

By exposing Rem to Al, they rendered him unable to think clearly and frozen in place. Then, they took advantage of that moment to use Compression to separate Al from his companions. This not only divided Al from his allies but also trapped him in a position where he was unable to move quickly, ――allowing them to successfully drag him away into the sky.

When it came to the crucial timing of the attack, Otto, who had been tracking Al and his gang while launching hit-and-run attacks, had prepared a message to be delivered in the event that he was killed, and this proved useful.

That signal meant that Al and his gang had defeated the formidable Otto, and that was the moment when their tension would ease, even if only slightly.

Rem: [Priscilla-san was very kind to me. As someone who cared deeply about her, I cannot stand by and watch Al-san’s outrageous actions any longer.]

Those were the words Rem used when she declared her intention to confront Al directly despite opposition to her decision.

After all, it was merely her mindset, the foundation of her determination, but it was also Rem's true feelings and the core of her unwavering motivation to face this battle.

Of course, right beside that core was Subaru, who had been captured by Al. In fact, he might be the core. ――No, Priscilla-san was also the core, so there were two cores. Beatrice-sama, will need to be apologized to later.

In any case, that determination decided Rem's participation in the team that would face Al directly.

Strategically speaking, there was no particular vision for using Rem on other battlefields, aside from the initial shock of using Memory. However, there was still a good chance that Rem could be effective against Al.

That possibility was exactly――,

Aldebaran: [To begin with, you’re not even supposed to be alive, lil’ miss Rem!!]

The moment the iron ball smashed down from above, Al blocked the powerful blow with his prosthetic arm made of rock and shouted angrily as he caught sight of Rem.

Despite being buffeted by roaring winds, Rem heard those words clearly, and she became certain that what Petra had told her about Al, whom Rem did not know, was true.

Rem: [Rem can't think of anything that connects her incompetent self to Al-san…]

She had checked with Ram, but it seemed that Ram's only contact with Al was once in the Royal Capital before the Royal Selection officially began. They had not had a conversation memorable enough to leave an impression, and even what they had talked about was ambiguous.

Perhaps the connection between the two sisters and Al was one-sided, coming only from him.

But――,

Rem: [Those words hurt! When we were attacked by Arakiya-san in Guaral, the people who saved us were Al-san and――]

Rem hesitated, but then swallowed her words and said,

Rem: [――Priscilla-san, wasn't it?]

Rem deliberately mentioned Priscilla's name in an attempt to unsettle Al.

Rem despised herself for resorting to the worst possible tactics. However, she knew that stopping Al's outrageous behavior was necessary, so she steeled her heart and fixed her stern gaze on him.

Aldebaran: [――――]

In response to Rem's provocation, Al chose to remain silent rather than respond vocally.

Inside his jet-black iron helmet, Al's expression was hidden behind his visor, his eyes unseen. It was impossible to tell how much pain Rem's words had caused him.

Rem: [――Let's go!]

However, Rem did not wait for Al's reaction and resumed her attack without giving him any time to rest.

Rem has already set her priorities. From the beginning, compared to Ram, who was talented and a genius, surpassing all other beings in this world, Rem was clumsy, mediocre, and inferior in every way.

If Rem sought something beyond the average person, then she would pursue it with all her determination.

For the time being, Rem was good at ignoring lower priorities to focus on higher ones.

Rem: [Huma!]

With that incantation, mana was released into the world, causing the impossible phenomenon known as magic.

Unlike Emilia's Huma, which manipulated heat and condensed moisture in the air to create ice, Rem's Huma was specialized in creating water from nothing using magic and producing it as ice from the start.

Neither Huma was necessarily superior, but the Emilia-type Huma, which utilized the moisture in the air, required less mana and had the advantage of remaining in place after it had been cast, allowing it to be used again. On the other hand, the Rem-type Huma required more mana because it created water from nothing, and after it was used, it returned to mana and left no trace.

Based on that explanation alone, the Emilia-type Huma would seem to be overwhelmingly superior. However, the Rem-type Huma had its own powerful advantages.

This was due to the fact that it could create ice at any desired location and in any desired shape, regardless of the amount of moisture in the air or the quality of the water――,

Rem: [――Haaaaaa!!]

Rem kicked off the ice platform she had created in midair and lunged fiercely at Al and his companion.

By creating a Huma with a fixed location, an impromptu platform could be created that would not break even if Rem kicked with all her might. The power of the Morning Star was unleashed after gaining a momentary boost from the platform, and it was incomparable to the one delivered only with the power of twisting her entire body.

The iron ball spun violently as it hurtled toward Al, showing no mercy.

It was capable of easily crushing a human body upon direct impact. It was as if it was responding to the affection Subaru had shown by polishing it every day, with joy, Rem rushed toward Al, closer and closer, and closer――,

???: [I won't let you do that.]

At the moment of impact, the iron ball of love was caught by countless threads.

Upon closer inspection, it was the crimson shinobi in Al's arms, twisting her body to glare at Rem. ――She was a powerful thread user who followed Al.

The shinobi, embraced from behind by Al, spread the threads she had extended from both hands into a net and used it to softly catch the iron ball as if it were a cushion.

Her skills were impressive, but that was not what caught Rem's attention.

In the first place, the plan behind this surprise attack was to completely isolate Al from his allies by throwing him into the air. The fact that she intervened was crazy. ――No, crazy was not the right word. Rem knew why she had done it.

Despite everyone being completely overwhelmed by Rem's sudden appearance, she left enough space for herself to reach out and actually take action.

What made her do that――,

Rem: [――It's love!]

Aldebaran: [That’s wrong!]
Shinobi: [That is wrong!]

To Rem's confident cry, Al and the Shinobi shouted back almost simultaneously.

Taking advantage of that opening, Rem forcefully pulled back the Morning Star that was about to be taken from her and retrieved the iron ball from the Shinobi, who was reluctant to lose her balance. In preparation for her next attack, she created multiple new footholds, kicked off them, and rapidly descended to catch up with the two.

However――,

Shinobi: [It's scary when someone catches up to you, but everything comes around eventually, right?]

The Shinobi, who had been tense, relaxed her expression and flashed a charming smile. The thread she shot flew toward the ice platform Rem had created in midair.

Suddenly thrown into the sky, Al and his companion had no choice but to fall freely, but it seems that they are trying to regain their footing using the platform Rem created.

From what she has heard, the Shinobi's skills exceeded Rem's. If the opponent were able to compensate for the disadvantage she had been given, the difference in strength that had been somewhat narrowed would be reversed in no time.

Rem: [Yes, that's right. I tend to be a bit shortsighted.]

That was why Rem did not let her opponents take advantage of her shortcomings.

Shinobi: [――Hk!]

Hearing Rem's reply, ――the feeling she had once grasped vanished like mist, and the Shinobi's expression once again lost its composure.

The ice platform she had tried to use as a foothold vanished as if it were a dream or an illusion. Of course, it was neither a dream nor an illusion. It was mana. Rem had simply converted it back to mana at will.

This was the big difference between the Emilia type Huma, which, once frozen, stays frozen, and the Rem type, which freezes only when desired and was easy to remove.

Rem: [Simply put, Rem is the type to be on the offensive.]

Right before Rem's eyes, the Shinobi lost her balance as the power she had gathered lost its target.

Al, who was holding the Shinobi, was also caught in the crossfire and almost lost his balance, but he managed to reinforce his cracked prosthetic arm with additional armor and blocked a series of iron ball attacks thrown by Rem, twice, then three times.

At that point――,

???: [――Hiyaa!]

――Incoming from below, Emilia's long legs kicked mercilessly into Al's unprotected back with icearmor-clad toes.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The division of the Aldebaran Troupe.

Against a group rebelling against the world to an extent that rivalled the Witch Cult, even surpassing it in terms of instantaneous velocity, that was a prerequisite that they absolutely could not afford to mess up.

The surprise tactic performed in order to meet that condition, had gone about nine percent as planned. The ten percent miscalculation―― how the presence of the shinobi who had chosen to go along with them would come into play, was something that wounded the plan as an uncertain variable, but overly worrying about it would just be all the more harmful.

Each of them would fulfill their own part to the utmost.

After all, without that sort of faith and resolve, the stratagem to stop the Aldebaran Troupe would not bear any fruit.

???: [――Ma~n, everyone’s got those spine-chilling, irresistible looks in their eye~s!]

While saying this, Roy Alphard, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, swung his loosely dangling arms back and forth, casting a sadistic smile as he looked around.

Around him, immediately after Aldebaran and his group were sent flying, figures began to appear one after another, as if taking their place ――warriors who had gathered to defeat Aldebaran’s crew stood ready.

Each of them met the Sin Archbishop with unyielding gazes, causing Roy to instinctively lick his lips.

Roy: [Nice, real nice, maybe even perfect. But, y’know, with so many of you gathered like this, all that strength you’ve brought to take us down—might just get wiped out in one fell swoop, right?]

???: [――Ha! You should show a little more fear and cower. If you don't want to die the same way as your brother at the sand tower.]

???: [And you guys even have Witchbeast-chans in your strike zo~ne? If not, then I think I’m your natural ene~my.]

Among the warriors, one figure who had clutched their own elbow and another who had smoothed down their braid had responded as such. Despite their unmistakable hostility, Roy hadn’t hidden his trembling smile, filled with anticipation for the feast ahead.

???: [T-this isn’t a joke… can’t you all see the Divine Dragon here!? You know how much damage it did to the Royal Capital… there’s no chance that you can win this!]

Contrary to the elated Roy, Heinkel’s voice trembled with a face deathly pale.

As per his words, he stood right by the feet of the Divine Dragon while relying on its intimidation, and in response to hostility glaring at them, he fervently raised his voice with a loathsome expression.

That figure ought to be called “a man who borrows the might of Dragons”, but Heinkel’s point was in fact not mistaken. The Divine Dragon possessed absolute power, if one were to stand in its way without a plan, what awaited them was a curtain’s close of merciless annihilation.

???: [Tho’, that’s only if ya ain’t got a plan.]

Heinkel: [――Hk, the old giant.]

???: [That old giant’s seen the Demi-Human War. Never again will I give mercy ta those barin’ their fangs against me. ――I’ll be havin’ ya return Felt.]

Before Heinkel as his breathing choked up and he averted his gaze, the giant stroked his bald head, and declared. At the giant’s proclamation, Heinkel’s cheeks tensed up, but, there was another figure that began to stir.

And that, was none other than the Dragon he had singled out earlier.

Dragon: [I dunno if I should be saying this, but it makes me damn nervous that we’ve been pushed to this extent. I’m keenly feeling what it means to make an enemy of the world.]

Despite being a Dragon of such dignified appearance, it placed its hand on its head in a strangely human-like gesture.

While giving off a sense of presence such that the majority of those who lived in the Dragon Kingdom would prostrate themselves just by laying eyes upon it, the way it conducted itself made it seem like an entirely different thing.

At the very least, in the eyes of those who knew the real Divine Dragon, the sense of something being amiss was palpable.

???: [But then again, unlike the dignitaries of the Kingdom, I'm in no such panic about the image of the Divine Dragon crumbling, or of its <u>brand</u> value pluuumetting~. ――Onlyyy~, I wonder about the one next to me? Wouldn't you have quite a few reservaaations~?]

???: [No, Master, you needn’t worry. Groundless fear. It would be laughable for me to pile words onto a past that I have already shed. Feeble.]

Looking down on those who showed no fear before the dragonhusk that did not align with its own mind or stature, “Aldebaran” narrowed its golden eyes.

Among those standing in their way, attention began to converge on a small silhouette slowly stepping forward. Naturally, Roy and Heinkel also shifted their attention to that silhouette.

It was unclear how that individual had come to stand in that position, but strangely enough, they understood without the need for words to tell them. ――That girl represented the will of everyone present.

At the center of everyone’s attention, the girl―― Petra Leyte thrust her finger up towards the heavens, and spoke.

Petra: [――It’s all-out war. Be a doll and let yourselves get thoroughly defeated, alright?]

So she declared.
